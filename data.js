We have successfully shipped furniture all over the contiguous United States.  Larger items can be shipped LTL (less than [full] loan) with major carries or smaller independent carriers.  \n\nSubstance Modern can offer you complete shipping services for anything you buy.  We can also help you coordinate delivery via the shipper of your choice.  Shipping cost vary dramatically depending on your location, the larger metropolitan areas typically have lots of freight traffic and you can often find carriers that already have a delivery in your area or are passing through and they will offer highly competitive pricing.\n\nFeel free to check out UShip and Plycon for ideas on terms, schedule, and pricing and message us with any questions.\n\nWILL YOU SHIP ITEMS GREYHOUND?\nWe do on a case by case basis.  The nearest terminal that accepts packages is an hour away so we reserve the service only for items too large for post and too small for freight.  Any items that require special packing (lamps, fragile furniture) must be professionally packed to go Greyhound.  I have a local company that does this and is fantastic, they usually run $20-$50 depending on the item.\n\nMY ORDER ARRIVED DAMAGED, WHAT SHOULD I DO?\nDon&#39;t worry, though we use the utmost care in packing, items do occasionally get damaged in transit.  Regardless of how the item was shipped save all your packing materials, take photos of the damage, and contact us immediately.  If your order was shipped USPS you can file claims directly here (assuming you purchased insurance):\n\nhttps:\/\/www.usps.com\/help\/claims.htm\n\nIf you order was shipped LTL you can file claims directly with the carrier through their insurance policy.  If freight shipping was provided by Substance Modern we will handle the claim and issue your refund once all documentation is received.\n\nMY USPS TRACKING INFORMATION ISN&#39;T UPDATED, WHAT SHOULD I DO?\nWe have shipped hundreds of packages USPS and we have never had a package lost in transit.  Occasionally a parcel will get &quot;stuck&quot; at a postal hub and tracking information won&#39;t be updated.  USPS will allow you to make a claim 30 days after the scheduled delivery date if the item has not arrived.\n\nTHE CARRIER SAYS MY PACKAGE WAS DELIVERED BUT IT&#39;S NOT HERE, WHAT SHOULD I DO?\nContact your carrier (if USPS local post office and speak to the postmaster).  Most carriers have policies for claims regarding lost or stolen packages.\n\nCAN I MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY OWN SHIPPING?\nAbsolutely, I will gladly drop off your items at the shipper of your choice as long as they are nearby.  I can also make recommendations.\n\nIS LOCAL PICKUP AT OPTION?\nAbsolutely!  I am located an hour from the Holland tunnel and approximately 90 minutes from Center City Philadelphia.  You are welcome to come and pick up your purchase, please coordinate timing with us first.","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":null,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/SubstanceModern?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/185\/0\/15384096\/iusb_760x100.26036248_tb5v.jpg","num_favorers":23,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/197\/0\/15384096\/isla_fullxfull.26853233_fqxipm7v.jpg","is_using_structured_policies":true,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":true,"has_unstructured_policies":false,"include_dispute_form_link":false,"is_direct_checkout_onboarded":true,"is_wholesale_only":false}},{"listing_id":467833881,"state":"active","user_id":39415739,"category_id":69150425,"title":"Groomsmen Gift, Whiskey Decanter, Engraved Whiskey Decanter, Personalized Decanter Set With 2 Glasses,  Wedding Gift, Gift For Men","description":"A custom whiskey decanter and a glasses set can be a great gift for the connoisseur of exquisite drinks.

Please make sure it is the correct address, or let me know if the shipping address is different than indicated on the receipt.

I ship replacements only after the full six weeks.\r\n\r\nCUSTOMS CHARGES\r\nLarger items that are shipped outside of the United States may incur additional fees, taxes, tarifs, duties, or customs charges.

No framing is required! Just take it out of the package and hang it on your wall!\r\n-- Images are printed on archival artist canvas, then firmly wrapped and secured around a sturdy, solid frame, with neat, perfectly folded corners.\r\n-- Sawtooth hanging hardware is pre-installed.\r\n-- Canvas prints are finished with a clear acrylic coating, providing a scratch-resistant outer layer with a satin luster.\r\n-- The sides of the print are wrapped around the stretcher bars, giving the print a gorgeous three-dimensional look.\r\n-- I always try to begin the printing process within 24 hours of receiving the order. However, please note that canvas prints can take much longer to deliver than paper prints. CANVAS PRINTS CAN TAKE 10-12 BUSINESS DAYS TO DELIVER. If that doesn&#39;t work for you, I recommend that you order a paper print instead.","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1439566335,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/VeryImage?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/209\/0\/9164880\/iusb_760x100.30399737_7crb.jpg","num_favorers":327,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/125\/0\/9164880\/isla_fullxfull.22282049_m1ddw6up.jpg","is_using_structured_policies":false,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":false,"has_unstructured_policies":true,"custom_shops_state":3,"include_dispute_form_link":false,"is_direct_checkout_onboarded":true,"is_wholesale_only":false}},{"listing_id":599060831,"state":"active","user_id":55480211,"category_id":68887546,"title":"Pinot Noir Candle","description":"Subtle Scents of Pinot noir, vanilla, and raspberries in a recycled wine bottle.","creation_tsz":1520541368,"ending_tsz":1531078568,"original_creation_tsz":1520541368,"last_modified_tsz":1520541369,"price":"21.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"tags":["sexy","soy wax","whiskey","smell","fresh","glass","scent","candle","wood wick","recycle","wine bottle"],"category_path":["Candles","Container"],"category_path_ids":[69150375,68887546],"materials":[],"shop_section_id":null,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1520541368,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/599060831\/pinot-noir-candle?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":0,"num_favorers":0,"shipping_template_id":54892048417,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":2,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2018","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":null,"is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","should_auto_renew":true,"language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":1005,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living","Home D\u00e9cor","Candles & Holders","Candles","Container Candles"],"used_manufacturer":false,"sku":[],"Images":[{"listing_image_id":1447233700,"hex_code":"815D3F","red":129,"green":93,"blue":63,"hue":27,"saturation":51,"brightness":50,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1520541369,"listing_id":599060831,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/191\/0\/14817264\/il_75x75.1447233700_qgxt.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/191\/0\/14817264\/il_170x135.1447233700_qgxt.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/191\/0\/14817264\/il_570xN.1447233700_qgxt.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/191\/0\/14817264\/il_fullxfull.1447233700_qgxt.jpg","full_height":3000,"full_width":2250}],"Shop":{"shop_id":14817264,"shop_name":"NostalWick","user_id":55480211,"creation_tsz":1490013183,"title":"Homemade candles in recycled whiskey bottles","announcement":"From sip to sniff","currency_code":"USD","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":null,"sale_message":null,"digital_sale_message":null,"last_updated_tsz":1514660420,"listing_active_count":10,"digital_listing_count":0,"login_name":"aliciacooley1","accepts_custom_requests":false,"policy_welcome":null,"policy_payment":null,"policy_shipping":null,"policy_refunds":null,"policy_additional":null,"policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":0,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/NostalWick?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/181\/0\/14817264\/iusb_760x100.25756880_tsla.jpg","num_favorers":5,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/194\/0\/14817264\/isla_fullxfull.29610506_9ceng0so.jpg","is_using_structured_policies":false,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":false,"has_unstructured_policies":false,"include_dispute_form_link":false,"is_direct_checkout_onboarded":true,"is_wholesale_only":false}},{"listing_id":83147163,"state":"active","user_id":6938879,"category_id":69150425,"title":"mad men glasses, silver dorothy thorpe roly poly glasses, vintage 1960s barware","description":"Fantastic 1960&#39;s vintage Dorothy Thorpe style roly poly glasses.

The size is just an estimate (unless stated on the tag), and vintage sizes are different than modern sizes. Please use measurements to ensure proper fit. To determine whether a vintage item will fit you is to compare the measurements given with that of a similar garment that does fit you.\n\nCARE INSTRUCTIONS\nGlassware: I assume no responsibility for glassware once you have received\/used it. 99% of vintage glassware cannot handle a dishwasher and should only be hand washed with care. It&#39;s best to use a mild detergent and soft sponge, towel, or even your hand when washing these glasses. \n\nClothing: Most of my items are cleaned before listed, but it&#39;s always best to rewash or dry cleaned before wear.\n\nNY STATE RESIDENTS\n8.75% sales tax added for NY state residents.\n\nWHEN BUYING VINTAGE\nAll items are pre-owned, please expect natural wear. I do my best to note flaws but may overlook small things from time to time. \n\nDetailed and accurate measurements are provided on every item that is listed. It is the buyers responsibility to check the measurements and ensure it will fit properly.\n\nMaterials can degrade over time, which is something you should keep in mind, particularly when buying vintage shoes. I do my best to check over each item for any flaws or material degradations. However, I do not have the ability to know how much wear a vintage item can handle before it becomes unwearable\/unusable.\n\nRETURN INFO\nI do accept returns on items. Items must be unworn and sent back in the same condition as they were sent. Please contacting me within 5-14 business days of receiving your item.\n\nOTHER INFO\nSome garments might be clipped to show how the clothing should fit properly. Colors vary from monitor to monitor. Accessories not included, unless stated in the listing. Please consider this when purchasing. \n\n\nPlease feel free to email me if you have any questions or problems with any purchase!\n\nLAYAWAY\nI do offer layaway for items in the shop.
